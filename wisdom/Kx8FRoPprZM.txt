 hey guys john this is very important you know i have my power xl juicer right here you know oh anyways theres some vagine magic clean uh cooking spray just letting you know my satellite man has been burning my teeth but uh you know im cooking stir-fry right now you know but uh you know i added some extra chicken to it but you know in reference to when you use your power xl or you use a juicer the satellite mans been hitting me right here in the forehead and theyre hurting my ear right here and theyre hurting my upper lip and teeth theyre dry lipping underneath my teeth right now underneath my lips attempted murder dehydration attempts to murder every single day for the past  years specific mutation plus well you know in reference to the xl uh power xl juicer in a reference to juicing when you get like your vegetables and fruits if youre wanting to eat the pulp or youre wanting to put the pulp in your beverage you you only put certain select vegetables or fruits in there at the time you might want to peel them and you want to put them in your xl juicer or your other juicer whatever juice or somebody has so in reference to that you want to put like you want like tomato skins or you wanted the apple skins or you wanted the orange peel pulp or you wanted grape skins or blueberry skins or or you know cantaloupe you know you got to peel a cantaloupe you got to peel honeydew you got to peel a watermelon if youre wanting to eat the pulp of this basically because its not you know it may not taste all that good the reverence to just the skin outside of it but the juicer makes it wonderful of course but you know just like based on certain things of the pulp you can only put certain things in there at a time like uh when you uh when you put things in there that was uh one of the tv shows but if you put the pulp in your beverage you want to use certain choices like apple skins you know you people eat apple skins all the time they eat grape skins they eat uh mango skins or you know other particular types of fruits or vegetables you know so in reference to or blueberries or grapes like i mentioned when you put that in your juicer you want to separate that pulp from any other type of pulp that you might put in there so in reference to uh satellite mans hurting my left leg and i hurt my tailbone so and hips the satellite man is trying to play this voodoo doll terrorism but you know in reference to the juicer or the fruits and vegetable choices you know you want to you want to prep them to put them in your power xl if youre wanting to eat the pulp if youre wanting to put the pulp in your beverage and and that doesnt take very long you know you you know its its a process but then you have you know gobs of pulp that you can put in your beverage and it tastes wonderful so remember see your select choices of vegetables or fruits or strawberries you know when you put strawberries in there of course it extracts the juice but then the pulp of the skin of the strawberries goes into the catcher that catches the pulp and you know strawberries are delicious you know so you always want to peel off the you want to cut off the green leafy part of it i mean some people might eat that if they want to but in reference to you know getting the pulp you only want to get the pulp that you want to eat from the fruit or the vegetable that you put in your power xl which is wonderful you know it tastes wonderful its amazing like if you use broccoli or use you know because broccoli has a lot of pulp and uh you know celery has pulp to it too you know so in reference to you know other things like uh let me see like you know bananas you know it extracts the banana juice its wonderful its amazing but you know in reference to peeling the banana and getting the pulp of it you only want to catch the pulp you want to eat in reference to whatever type of vegetable or fruit that youre putting in there at the time so then you want to separate that from other juices that youre going to make when you prepare your your juice and your your your prep your vegetables and the fruits to where you can eat the pulp where it tastes good that way you know in reference to you know removing certain uh pulp type things that you dont want to to eat such as things that may not be too tasty or too edible in reference to basics of things you know so in reverse too they just hit me in the lips the satellite man did now thats racist everything theyre doing is criminal and racist all these satellite controllers they have to get prosecuted its attempted murder and its mutilation now theyve damaged my teeth for over three and a half years since they broke the first tooth but theyve been burning and damaging and skinning my face and teeth and they have damaged like some of my birthmarks that are on my face and i you know theyve damaged them theyve theyve been chapping my face with satellites and caused uh they tried to erase my birthmarks which are in the royal protocol  hours a day which are supposed to be there and this satellite man needs to get prosecuted all these people need to get prosecuted but rather than the power xl its very wonderful it works great its amazing and uh it works good but you know in reference to your selective choice what you put in there if youre wanting to eat the pulp or you want to add the pulp to your beverage you might want to prep your vegetables prep your fruits for what pulp you want to put in your beverage to eat yeah so its kind of one of those things its simple acknowledgements and in reference to you know the power xl right here you know it works wonderful and im cooking stir fry which im pretty much done with the cooking the stir fry lots of things reporting to see you guys later have a good day good night
