 again that satellite man just communicated something there he tried to say he said he thought  miles an hour was too fast in the bike lane well you know bicycles are usually a smaller vehicle than cars so you know reference to riding with traffic or the general speed of traffic and either way whether a person rides a bike in the street most generally just depends on the speed of the bike a person would ride closer to the shoulder side of the lane so no matter what excuse you say its more lawsuits because you tried to get out of it tried to cover up your lies wheres my e-bike at man the ones you switched it with and you know when i was riding back from the indy bike schools uh any bike store there was a girl that was on the opposite side of the street and she was getting on the bus and she had a bike just like mine but it didnt have like an e-bike kit on it but she was getting on the shes waiting at the bus stop i dont know who she is or anything but i saw a bike that she had same color too
