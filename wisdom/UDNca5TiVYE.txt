 how you guys doing uh somebody tried to communicate something about the song eye of the tiger or um you know other particular movie theme songs or songs from like the s or particular films or you know some people want to know if i was the singer for i have the tiger uh you have to ask somebody you know over here where im at the satellite terrorists have always tried to play tricks or or you know other music and hello toto musical group and uh other uh breathe musical group and other particular musical groups you know people want to know you know what types of songs pop music from the s that i sang when i wore disguises or you know people have to uh people have to make youtube videos about things over here is is kind of limited on some things you know these uh satellite controllers or the activities of things or people wanting to know what songs i sang with my mother like uh you know romance songs or s love ballads or rock and roll you know people have to put it out there because where im at over here these people are illegally censoring or theyre intercepting uh videos or theyre trying to steal everything you see theyre pulling theyre messing with my eye thats what they wanted me to mention the eye of the tiger or something quit dont do that see they put that bag under my eye just in the last few seconds last few minutes they swelled up my left eyeball so you know they were trying to make me mention the eye of you better quit that you better quit thats another lawsuit if you know satellite man yeah look at that that only took a matter of seconds and they did that they swelled up my eyeball right there the bag under the eye look on the previous video that i made a few minutes you know about what  minutes ago or something but somebody wanted me to mention whether i was a singer or they wanted me to mention the song i have the tiger and well my teeth wasnt like that so in reference to you know ive worn disguises and movies and you know because a lot of people like my talent or they like uh you know me singing or my family history or the talent of my mother and father and and uh music and movie history and directing and writing and producing and you know very important but you know they ed swelling up my eyeball so someone wanted me to mention i guess something about the song i have the tiger and uh you know a lot of disguises that ive worn in reference to you have to look it up to see if i sing that song you know somebody has to put it up there you know but you know in the future im going to wear disguises for other you know movie productions and music too but the thing of it because it fits into certain genres like certain songs like uh you know r b music or rock and roll music you know or certain types of music you know some themes are based on certain uh friendliness of things you know like a lot of times when im saying r b music obviously you know that ive dressed up as a black person or you know reverence too when ive played piano and sometimes theres videos youll see videos of me wearing a disguise or wearing a tuxedo or wearing certain uh flashy clothing or if i sang songs or whichever it might be im not trying to cover anything up and rather understanding music or movies that ive been in you know usually if ive been in a movie you know its uh if i were a disguise its supposed to be in the credits too but uh because most people dont even look at those but you know its its a kind of like put it out there neutrally to see which people like the song or like the music or like the movie and you know the real protocol of my identities in the media  hours a day its in movies tv shows music videos and lots of things but you know in reference to me performing same thing with bodybuilding you know uh you know people will try to say well they thought this or they thought that well ive you know you know wore uh makeup and you know uh fake faces in reference to bodybuilding in reference to some things you know and uh its you know particular marketing particular uh interest of you know productions and people enjoying or liking certain things without the the stigma of dirty government or the stigma of tricks of you know psychos or terrorists or you know theres a reason for wearing disguises and movies and tv shows i dont wear disguises out in public its not a public thing you know but in reference to performing or wearing uh you know darker skin complexion or makeup or costume designs or you know thats thats a particular of you know in reference to history of putting something out there and letting people look at it and be interested or not interested you know its not a you know theres not forced media but in remembrance to the government terrorizing my life for people trying to murder me and people trying to hurt me and people damaging things on my body thats mainstream factual news and theres guidelines that has to be presented in the news media so i remember seeing a lot of s songs or even s songs when i was a little boy and uh you know duets a lot of the music artists like you know if i do some duets with uh you know r b artists rock and roll artists uh uh country music artists you know sometimes aware of disguise and you know that needs to be presented too like its kind of like something will be you know putting something together playing it for a while and then revealing you know the fact of if it was one of my songs or one of my uh music performances or dance or acting roles or movies so its kind of like you know in revenues for certain films but a lot of people like to see films that ive been in and theres some people that say they like to watch you know films that ive directed or songs or music videos or things so its kind of like theres some people in like the fan clubs that want to know and you know they keep a little secretive for you know for the in the you know particulars of peoples interests you know people like oh wow we want to know this or lets think about this you know to entice the uh curiosity of people and saying wow that was pretty good you know we like that oh wow that was him in that song wow that was him in that movie or wow that was him on that tv show when he was little or wow you know thats kind of interesting you know and uh but you know somebody mentioned about my hollywood friends im not blocking my hollywood friends from hanging out with me i dont know you all have to get the names of these men that are blocking people from sending me things in the post mail like friends that are hollywood friends of mine or that tried to send me letters i dont know maybe you should have walmart deliver it or something call walmart call walmart and ask them to deliver letters to the post through the postal mail to me or something because it seems like theyre the only ones that can get things through the postal mail or fedex but anyways uh you know its pretty serious you know in reference to my career is forever you know im the owner of my mother and fathers studios and you know the hollywood social light friendliness and conversations hello ellen ellen said hello i guess youd say and uh some other people you know im being held hostage and you know the satellite man has been damaging my face and teeth and theyve been holding me hostage and i have to try to get my keyboard back from the pawn shop and uh you know its just so i can play around on my keyboard and um now this satellite man tries to terrorize me when i sing songs and thats illegal is my freedom rights to sing songs or sing songs along with uh youtube or you know ive been a singer since i was a little boy in the entertainment industry as everybody knows now just think about which little boy i i am from videos and movies and tv shows you may not be able to figure it out no more disguises too sometimes when i was a little boy singing songs never been involved in any scandals either those people have made all those scandals i dont know nothing about those people but they tried to slander my good name in my family history so anyways very important the eyeballs still is still swollen under there many things of importance but you know my teeth have always been perfect ive always wore you know my teeth are very important and uh these people have damaged my teeth and theyre trying to heal and every time they touch it causes more damage but you know in reference to you can see pictures of my teeth when i was a little boy when i performed as a different race or a different color or different uh type of genre of movies or music or media lots of things of importance lots of things to talk about in the future so you know people need to tell the bad people leave everybody alone because people are interested in things about celebrity history and you government people dont have a right trying to murder celebrities whoever you bad people are because there are some people that are fans of people whether you like that celebrity or not or that entertainer you dont have a right trying to mess up their faces or teeth or anything and your health or skeletal crimes and seven deadly sins or fatal attraction crimes of these dirty people people need to go to court man
