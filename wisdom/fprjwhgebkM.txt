 how you guys doing this is very important in reverence to history of uh the situat one of the situations you know in reference to the hartford insurance company and their attempts of murder you know they hired i guess some detective in indiana that had went out to california to try to murder me and theyve been burning my upper lip i guess the satellite the harford insurance company uses a satellite with this the cia detective or something that was trying to frame me trying to call me a fake you know my teeth are real this ***** just calls everything fake and then it s burning and frying peoples identities i want hello howdy doody show and mickey mouse club how you guys doing you guys got the footage information from shows i was on right and other tv shows growing up you guys know who my parents are right but anyways and remember the hartford insurance company and you know i was riding in dusty sorgs mx mazda which is a foreign car its a japanese car you know and uh i was a passenger see i was over i was at my apartment and then he came over one morning kind of hesitant or it was like close to the afternoon or whatever time it was but i just you know sleeping and i had a girlfriend there and i was asleep we were asleep but uh he came over and he needed me to drive him to the airport or needed me to ride with him to the airport because he had to go somewhere really bad or something he had to go home or something but uh you know i was a passenger in the vehicle so i wasnt driving this vehicle or anything like that we were driving down sunset boulevard and you know where the sahara hotel is our motel its a motel where they filmed the movie species you know the model girl was in the movie and forest whitaker how you doing and some other peoples and and uh whats his name uh michael madison was in that movie too but uh and some other people too you know its just very important but you know we were driving down there and this this vehicle it was a gmc jimmy truck that pulled in front of us now note the information im a passenger in the vehicle and they crashed or there was a be this other truck the gmc bronco jimmy style truck pulled on turned in front of us so then we hit he hit the side of it broadsided it but the man made an illegal turn i mean he didnt even he didnt even look right you know he didnt like really cautiously drive or whatever but you know the front of the vehicle got smashed up like this you know the red its a red mx there is photographs of it and it needs to be put on a website too but you know this detective or the cia detective or fbi detective my mother had already sued their branch of government before for trying to murder me back in the s but this man thought it was his in way his way to get in on another attempts of murdering me i mean his tricks because he was working for these people that was trying to steal land in indianapolis that my mother owned you know and uh so you know the car was all smashed up i even sent pictures back from california and you know i was covered under the underinsured motorists of the hartford insurance company now note the information i was a passenger it wasnt in my vehicle and the underinsured motorist is is a insurance policy that if you were in an accident in somebody elses car that your own insurance would try to would cover things you know but the this detective and these government people they had i dont know if tammy sadine had connections with any of these cia or fbi people that tried to murder me that came from indiana im not sure but they were telling her or that she they were manipulating her she was involved with these men im not sure but she was my attorney but you know my own insurance company was fighting me and they were withholding the monies instead of paying me and it went on for like three years or how many years to go on in california like three years or something one that long maybe two years or something you have to look it up but uh then there was another situation here in indianapolis when this lady tried to broadside my vans she crashed into me and uh then the swoopy s-w-o-p-e uh law offices never paid me a ***** thing the lady ran the red light or whatever you know but i had like an injured shoulder and you know i was coming back from lowes department store i was putting wood out here for a wood deck you know because it kind of gets muddy out here sometimes in the yard but you know i just needed something just to make it look decent but anyways id buy a discount wood you know and go through the checkout and be like oh how much is this wood how much is that what you know basic information but then they intentionally this lady crashed into me or something and but thats another story but anyways back to the other hartford insurance company they tried to murder me theyve been frying me with satellites for over  ***** years i guess these people are tied in with these cia people and they tried to steal my lawsuit monies now when i was in california i had to send money back to deposit into a bank here and when i did that these people in indiana stole my ***** money out of my checking account that was here so then they kept stealing the money i mean and uh but back to the other point of when i was in california and after the accident the insurance company tried to murder me the insurance company in this detective who was in the fbi or cia was trying to call me a fake even when dr chu had x-rays of my spinal cord x-rays of my anatomy x-rays of my teeth and face and he knew it was a real accident obviously he was a spinal cord physician you know and uh and these people kept terrorizing me these government people would id go to the store that somebody would be staring at me like like like they were trying to act like they thought i was some fake or some ***** like somebody was faking it i kept working after the accident i still kept trying to work you know ive had an injured back or you know these people tried to break my back over  times or something in the past  years but you know the vehicle i was riding in was the mx- mazda and you know my mother and father had business with japanese people and some other asian uh countries you know but this is the point of these racists or whoever they are thats been terrorizing me but uh you know the activity of me riding in his vehicle and the vehicle crashing then this detective the fbi and cia man was trying to murder me and trying to call me a fake when the x-rays are documented my spinal cord is documented everythings documented and uh this this government man was trying to murder me and then he tried to rape me this fbi cia man that was from indiana that was out in california was trying to rape me and you know my mother had had court cases against indiana holding me hostage back in the s so this was like uh this is when i was out in california so it was like   maybe it was like  but like  or  with a   but anyways these people have been trying to murder me all these years they ***** up my teeth theyre tied in with the other satellite controllers that ***** up my face and teeth and you know i was a passenger in the vehicle dusty sorgs mx he used to work at mels drive-in too but i was a passenger in this vehicle so you know my insurance company was refusing to pay but allstate paid and uh they paid right away kind of you know but uh because they knew it was an accident or whatever and uh but then the hartford insurance company was trying to play tricks on me and they tried to murder me i dont know if they shot at me or what but their office is over on laos properties and theyre all tied in with the cia i guess so the homeland security office thats over at laos properties and they had shot at me someone had shot at me over there when i was cleaning the parking lots so basically you know i was a passenger in my vehicle i mean not my vehicle excuse that i was a passenger in his vehicle i wasnt a passenger in my vehicle it was in his vehicle that i was a passenger and they mess with my mouth anyways and uh so its not the fault of the insurance company and its not my fault but the insurance policy covered me if i had been riding in somebody elses vehicle and got injured and i had gotten injured being a passenger in somebody elses vehicle but then my own insurance company tried to murder me and im not sure if the ray family was involved in that meaning in reference to uh any person of their family im not sure or and then they said that frank sinatra had been tampering with tammy sadine which was one of my was the attorney and then they somebody had tried to say that frank sinatra had phone calls with her or something and this government man was accusing me of drugs and ***** when i was a pastor ive never done drugs i always worked my job when i worked somewhere i always you know normal schedule worked at jobs you know you know didnt have no uh missed days of any except well i had injuries from spinal cord but i mean like prior to the car accident you know ive always worked my job or whatever and uh still kept working though as a waiter at mels drive-in on sunset boulevard and now i worked at lipit and some other places but but during the accident was mels driving now ive been
