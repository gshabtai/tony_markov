 oh how you guys doing you know in reference to me being held hostage it doesnt take away from my seniority in hollywood and it doesnt take away from my mother and father and grandparents and family history in hollywood so in reference to people in hollywood that are uh claiming they thought theyd have more seniority by holding me hostage because theres obviously some people in hollywood that are conspiring with these people in indiana and in reference to financial laws and seniority laws of the media and entertainment industry and production companies dont forget im supposed to get credit for the productions of the movies that are produced at my mother and fathers companies im supposed to get production credits too and so are you know the history of my mother and father so just because im being held hostage you know its monies from my mother and fathers studios that are funding a lot of productions and im supposed to get credit for movie producing and productions of films and music and television so in reference to people trying to hide or trying to exclude my name from movie productions pete
