 another thing of importance in reference to wealth and family history and value like someone might say oh these people was multi-millionaires well thats interesting because you know it takes a thousand millions to make one billion right and it takes a thousand billions to make one trillion see they need the evaluation of financial levels of wealth in reference to my grandparents my mother and father and my family history of me being the child of my mother and father and grandparents and we need to see the margin the marginal difference like some of these people was millionaires when my grandfather and mother and father was trillionaires we need that uh margin put in the media in reference to the variable differences and the percentage differences of wealth like someone might say oh this person was worth  billion dollars oh thats a lot of money its a lot of money but my mother and father was worth over quadrillions of dollars you understand how that works and you know my grandfather was trillionaire pretty much and you know my mother and i was born as the trillionaire quadrillionaire baby when i was born look up the information look up the facts plus the lawsuits go up theyre still hitting me in the teeth right now so lets see what the difference like you know somebody say well this persons a millionaire well thats thats pretty good somebodys billionaire well thats a lot more isnt it thats a lot more well think about it it takes a thousand billions to make a trillion thats a hell of a lot of difference we need to see in the media the difference of financial wealth like for instance someone might say well this theres like uh  millionaires or  percent millionaires and then theres the billionaires you know those numbers as wealth gets higher the numbers are smaller in reference to the class of people and financial value this is important in reference to status and protection status and laws too so we need to see how rich you are satellite mans been hitting me in the face and teeth because youre not richer than me in my family history even though youre blocking me from all my money youre blocking me from my mother and fathers estates so we need to see how rich you are because we already know you dont have no legal right you never had a legal right and you goddamn wont ever have a legal right you need to show up in court
