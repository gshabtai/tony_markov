 what happens how you guys doing this is what happens when your landing gear or your uh your truck does not turn as sharp as it should like i got a i got a dime right here and a penny right here okay this is what it was over there with the truck so if your truck even though your tire your rear tractor tire is going to meet with your landing gear youll go back further if your truck does not turn sharp enough like okay this is like a regular turn okay when youre parallel parking but the coins here something like that now this is a this is like a regular turn like this when youre right there you see you see this short distance here and here and then youre back in your truck just to show the distance then youre straightening your truck up now in reverse two it not turning correctly when youre turning the steering wheel if its got a steering problem like the truck over at c has and ive had that truck four times it was probably five times but you know the first uh test it got messed up on the pre-trip uh well the four-point brake check so anyways back on this point yeah youll youll back up and it may not be as sharp but your trailer be eight to ten feet further back like see how the turn is there and youre way back in your trailer be way back here and youll after you straighten it out youll be like what the hell is going on you get out and you look youre like whats going on with this what the hell what whats going on here what what the hell is going on then you get back in your truck then youll be like thinking ***** whats going on because it doesnt turn as sharp so then youll be snaking it up this way and that way and then youll be you know trying to get it in there and you get another angle then youre too deep then you try to turn it and think oh thats going good but then you still youre tired your tractor still does not turn as sharp youre still outside the box then you try to snake it up again and youre like what the hell is going on especially if the mirrors are messing up too youd be like what the hell let me try to back it up again youre like ***** back in the same spot almost thats messed up because still not turning sharp enough to change the angle of which youre trying to get your truck in the parking spot and the parallel parking again like i said if it doesnt turn doesnt turn right or sharp enough you know when you look under in your mirror and youre looking for your landing gear if it doesnt turn sharp enough you know youll be back here like this outside the box then you have a regular proper steering of a tractor you know youll get that real sharp you know close and see the distance here again if it doesnt steer right once you turn your truck get to that landing gear youre like this now you see the distance thats like thats like eight to ten feet difference you try to straighten it out and back it up and youre like ***** still outside the box and you like pull it up again like what the hell is going on this is just crazy because you know why would they have a test vehicle that has bad ***** steering for the state of indianas testing that just dont make no sense does it like people setting you up for failure in the first place or booby-trapping something so anyways again when you do your first turn away from the box and youre getting your truck back there and you got your landing gear right there youre like oh okay this looks right but then you know even when youre struggling with the steering wheel or youre getting the this is with like regular steering you know you get it right youre like oh okay this is getting back there and then straighten it up and then oh ***** yeah that looks right oh yeah see look then youre like you got it right you know there but like i said before if you dont get that you know this is like a regular turn right here youre like right like that see the short distance and you got that sharper turn on your truck where it really turns the functions correctly and the steering if it doesnt your trucks going to be way back here youre gonna be way out here in no mans land and you straighten it up youre like holy ***** its in the wrong spot this is the state of indianas cdl testing site and this is a the vehicle is just absurd you know what i mean the fact of the steering when i was using it and dont forget one of the trucks blew up on me like the one i got it in there parallel parked but it blew up and you know ed smoking and everything and that was one day and then on the other day like say for instance thats well the same day that i was they got another truck they brought another truck over and say this is the traffic light and this is like the this the drive for the cd c uh facility so i got up here and like uh well say this is let me see let me see lets see right here is the median where i was driving fourth gear got it into fifth gear still going appropriate speed you know got up here and then turned and then it it stalled right there half the truck was still in the driveway of the training facility didnt even get out of the training facility still had the green light and the truck stalled there and then the but i was turning you know and i didnt hit the median but the truck stalled and i turned it on had it turned on like less than three or four seconds less than three seconds and still had the green light so i didnt impede traffic and there was no cars behind me either so it was like then it failed on that one but that was the same day that when i parallel parked the truck that blew up and thats probably you know they had fixed it and i guess that was the same truck i was using the other times too so they kept making me use this one vehicle that was that obviously had a very bad steering problem for my state cdl test like they were giving me this shitty truck every ***** time or every time that i had to take my cdl test that had bad steering every single time and i even told you know the director of uh c i even told the industry the inspector at the state i said hey you know this steerings messed up or something but you know either way thats just one of the points and you know thats very unfair that these this was going on when these people doing this you know people doing this to me you know very unfair and should be in court cases too so you know in reference to what i was telling you in remembrance to uh when youre back in the truck and it only goes you know the steering doesnt go as far your trucks can your trailers gonna end up a lot farther back if its got a and youre going to be way out there in the boondocks you know when uh youre trying to back it up if it only goes like this your trade is going to be way back here then youre gonna be trying to line it up you know you know and get back itll still youll still see the landing gear but you wont i mean you might realize it too but when youre trying to turn it youll see the landing gear but youll be eight to ten feet further back and you only have like a  foot margin you know what i mean so then trying to back it up and straighten it up and then youre like okay well wait and the dotted lines like right over here or something where its where its in between here and here its like in the middle of your trailer so then you gotta try to snake it back like this youre you know trying to back a  foot trailer where youre only getting like these small percentage turns in there and then youre going to get way out there then you get too deep because you have to try you try to overcompensate on the turn because the turn the initial turn was not sharp enough which you know you you go back like you know five six feet whatever it might be and you see your landing gear then you straighten it out but according to the you know the way that truck was you know youll be backing up backing up backing up backing up backing up and then youll get to where your landing gear is youll be way out here in this part because the truck swings out so far because you got such a small turn in there so you know its like look at that like that and a sharp turn like this and then you got your landing gear you know so rappers to a truck having bad steering you know you got a small turn in there youre gonna be way back here when your trailer gets in there and do it again you know sharp turn youll be like right in there you know maybe right there close your dotted line straighten it out that kind of thing steering problem with a tractor youll be going like this and thats what was happening and then the mirrors and the mirrors and you know when its got small turns the truck will go like this youll be like Music maybe trying to go left and right and you only get these small gains and when youre trying to and youll point out and thats what happens the steerings messed up on the truck thats what happened to me it kept you know when youre sitting there trying to get that trailer in there and the steerings not sharp enough you got to try to steal her you know you got to try to steer harder they messed my mouth you got to try to steer harder but then its just its not going the distance you know its not going the distance when youre trying to go over so then its going to youre going to point out every time you got this this and this and this and this when youre sitting there trying to go this way this way this way this way youre trying to move the trailer but the trailer is only moving you know a couple feet to the left or to the right when youre needing it to move you know you know more distance than that and thats whats going on and thats how you point out in the indiana state cdl test if you got some shitty truck with some shitty steering well its mainly the steering youre gonna point out because it wont turn right thats what i mean some people might get it in there i got it in there before but it was you know it was fighting it you know just to get it in the parallel park a parallel box and then the truck blew up they gather they should have it on all their surveillance video and you know in reference to uh their surveillance video let me see i turn this camera anyways reference to their surveillance video of me and the practice field on the range they should have that and submit that into court to the show in the rain on the range in the uh c uh practice area where id you know i would do it with not any points but the steerings messed up you you know i pointed out like you know too many points just trying to get that trailer in the box and you know because it had small gains like it would just like youll turn it youll just come like this your your trailer just moves over one or two feet but the you know when youre needing it to move five feet this way or four feet or whatever and its unfair that they did this to me on every test and it needs to be submitted into court in reference to the indiana state cdl uh uh testing site and the disrespect of them trying to them failing me with the fact that theyre the the tru the test vehicle that was used for the test had shitty steering and thats documented you can show that you show uh all the surveillance video when i drove the truck when i did the five exercises the one morning and then the next morning was the next day was the day i had my test i did four you know both sides you know or maybe a five two might have did a straight backing on that day but pretty much it was you know parallel uh right and offset right and but you know that it was an offset right and then a parallel right and there was an offset left and a parallel left you know you can check the surveillance video submit it into court it needs to be submitted into court maybe the supreme court needs to order the surveillance video when when i would do the parallel and offset or backing or backing offset in parallel however you want to listen to that particular point but uh i did it with no points didnt get points on it at all all right and then you know knowing that theres you know you can get points so maybe that go ahead one point and pulling up and getting it you know whatever perfectly uh and align where you want it you know one points no big deal five you know however many points without failing you know but in reference to pointing out meaning like gaining getting too many points and failing the test there was something wrong with the steering and that needs to be submitted into court and its unjustified that they failed me on my cdl because of the bad steering of the truck its no ***** people have always been trying to play tricks on me since my parents got murdered by the government and the government tried to steal my mother and fathers estates theyre trying to steal billions and they got all their little tricks and their games of their people well anybody ask a politician man who they think my parents are every governor and mayor needs to sign a paper saying who they think my parents are because every city and state has records of my identity and who my biological parents are very important information
