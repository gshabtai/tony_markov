 how you guys doing this is important in reverence to the history of females that ive dated that are models or actresses and girls that have stayed with me in my apartment in california or girls that dated me when my mother was alive in reference to females in hollywood and celebrity females you know this government man keeps trying to say that he thought all the girls i dated was ugly or something hes calling all the girls i dated unattractive and out of shape or something so in reference to females that i dated in hollywood females that knew my mother uh females that are friends of mine you know they can speak out against that mans comments you know some of the girls i dated some of them was some of the top supermodels someone might say in the world and some of the actresses that you know in hollywood and celebrity females and some musical artists too so you know this government man is trying to claim that he thought the girls that i dated or that i slept with or had relationships or with this man is trying to call everybody ugly this government satellite man so maybe some girls want to make some videos and and say that they were friends of mine or dated me or something
