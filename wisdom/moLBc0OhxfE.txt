 youre wondering somebody communicated that my mother had spent more than a few billion in indianapolis like my mother had bought certain neighborhoods or something some uh some places on the north side or somewhere you know so i dont know what the exact amount is but somebody had communicated something like maybe over three or four billion im not sure what it is so uh somebody needs to advertise that in the media in reference to when they held me hostage in indiana and my mother had spent a few billion dollars in indiana im not sure exactly how much but uh these people extorted and they still treated my mother like and these government people have been treating me like every time theyve held me hostage in indiana theyve never done nothing for me but slander and theyve always tried to murder me these dirty government people so we need all the names of all the government people my mother had conversations with in indianapolis indiana and all the court judges names and all the court peoples names and all the police and individuals and the beverly hills police department then some of them come over here in court back in the s when i had been held hostage here and new jersey cops some of them came over and attorneys when they were holding me hostage here back in the s that has to be advertised in the media too
