 when im up here at the dollar general the family dollar was closed and theyre closing probably in a few minutes or something but they didnt have what i needed here at the store so id go to another store but when i went in to look to see if they had what i wanted to get and they didnt have it it came back out that satellite man or something had put a kill switch or they did something on my battery where it wouldnt even light up you know and you know when i left the house had a full charge and the handle wouldnt even light up and remember to the the turn on button you know the throttle buttons so anyways im up here at the dollar general and i have to go to another store and that satellite man is still burning my teeth and face theyre still burning my face and teeth man Music
