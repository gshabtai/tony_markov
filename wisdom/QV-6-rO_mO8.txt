 well like this is checking it with the engine running the other one it lights up is the last one the engine running first prong nothing second prone not a hole no bugs flying around third one nothing fourth one nothing fifth ones the only one that lights up thats with the engine running ill shut off the engine okay this is what the engine this is with the engine off first pro or hole and the plug-in nothing second one nothing im gonna do other than that nothing in the second one nothing in the third one nothing in the fourth one the fifth one so you guys see that so in roberts two i dont know i guess that might be a plug issue because you know that with the engine on the first floor do not light up and only the fifth one so whether the engine is on or off the only one that lights up is the physical you guys understand that theres where all the fuses are checked i already checked all the fuses let me check them real quick again just to show you first use dragon fuse so thats obviously some type of issue there with that first plug the alternator plug oh show it later
