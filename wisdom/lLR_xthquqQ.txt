roll and blues and and hello bb king how you doing youre wonderful you know that and a lot of other uh r b and uh you know blues artists and low ac dc in reference to guitar playing acknowledgements of angus young and and uh stevie ray vaughan and eddie van halen and a lot of other people you know a lot of things of importance and a lot of other great actors and you know the the history of hollywood that these people are trying to destroy is disgusting activities of dirty government or whatever race these terrorists are people need to do stories about that you know these bad people trying to steal the media like you know these people trying to steal identities or or something you know these you know these people need to make their own stage performances of who they are you know these people trying to steal identities as a bunch of bs but you know ive performed as uh you know a musical artist a tv show artist and you know uh or you know actor and entertainer very important but uh in ravens too somebody was wanting to know if i was gonna be the person thats gonna portray or going to be the person that plays uh james brown in the movie like the biography im not sure if im going to be the the actor playing james brown and the james brown biography some people want to know some people theyd be like oh thats a stretcher oh wait oh no yeah you might be surprised some people might say you know james brown knows me and a lot of other actors and our singers and artists know who i am they wanted to know if i was going to be the one performing as james brown in the james brown biography kind of film im not sure some people uh are probably wondering and but does anybody know any other black artists ive performed as and ive performed as different tv actors and entertainers you know different friendly races of people and you know i performed as an asian and european obviously and and performed as a black artist in music or movies or tv or or even uh performed as a mixed artist uh mixed race artist basic information some people want want to know all the characters ive played and its important because you know im friendly im friendly with people and you know people can talk about it and discuss things and but you know in reference to this situation of a female and me getting married on television its an important thing like very fast you know you know whether that relationship stays for a long time could be a female friend that ive known a long time in hollywood or a female friend thats been a modeling friend for a long time you know just got to get something on tv you know and you know whether white black asian european or something i got to get out of indiana i cant stand it these people are hateful all the time this is one of the most racist cities and most disgusting histories of dirty government and perverts terrorizing me they even they had these court cases back in the s when they had kidnapped me from california and id been kidnapped from north carolina before they tried to kidnap me from chicago when i was little and dont forget i was in tv and movies when i was real little too you know when i was a newborn and uh you know i got injured and i was in a coma for several years and you know my parents of course they still kept producing movies and tv shows and things you know a lot of people know that information it was a long time i was in a coma from the injuries of dirty government and every time every time the government has ever made any attempts of hurting me or attacking me or any person they always have to do a investigation on those people to find out where they came from most of the time it has came from some jealous government man that they were jealous of my family history and these government people are usually not people from america there are people that came from another country that faked their american citizenship and then they tried to steal my parentss wealth so thats important too to find out who these people are but you know back to the point of uh james brown some people dont know if im going to play uh james brown in a biography you know i have to paint my skin if im going to do that but some people dont know i guess if im able to to sing that way ive had to sing numerous different ways and of course i think james brown is amazing most people do and you know that its that genre some people dont know much about that genre of music or or different bluesy uh music or different kinds of characters thats whats so wonderful about the media if you watch something in the media and you dont like it you just turn the channel or you can put in a video of or a compact disc video or dvd of something you do like you dont have a right tearing down people with satellites messing up their lives government man if you dont like whats on that channel you change the channel and watch something else its like you people damaged my face my face is my real face its from my parents genetics my teeth are my real teeth whether you like them or not you didnt have a right damaging them at all so you need to go into court ill make some more videos
