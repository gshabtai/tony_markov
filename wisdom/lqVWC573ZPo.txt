 so anyways i got the you know on there cables on there ill just take off the red cable and see what happens like so with the negative cable off the light for the battery doesnt come on showing low voltage ill take off the red cable Music so the negative cable stayed on or didnt come on and still not coming on strange isnt it maybe i should take it off the alternator so putting the positive cable back on theres a negative cable back on also over here ill shut it off and  it up again Applause makes a difference Applause im gonna close the door now this is when im gonna take the negative cable off the alternator ill take the positive cable off all right so now theres no warning light on the battery either way so what does that say what does that mean right maybe the battery was undercharged i dont know maybe it needed a charge so i dont know that particular situation is oh dont forget you know in reference to who i am got to follow all the factual guidelines of what my parents had on paper and the treasury has copies of that and its going to be published i mean i could be friends with lots of different types of people but you know in reference to property and land and companies theres guidelines and uh history anything so important on all my accomplishments uh people need to advertise my accomplishments whether its bodybuilding weightlifting track and field olympics nobel peace prizes any congressional medals of honor or any scholastic accomplishments the message with my throat you know lots of things important its like you know like sat scores or you know accomplishments like even the cdl accomplishment of the cdl test and other things too you know you know its all going to be documented in history books and its got to be documented at my mother and fathers mansions too you know in reference to you know ill go to my mother and fathers mansions with the papers and documents of all the accomplishments and theres going to be more accomplishments of the future too so i dont know i guess the battery might have needed a little more charge or something because it seems to be doing all right only time will tell huh lets see
