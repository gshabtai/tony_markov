you can answer on what would would you use your teeth for government man too small somebody said that just communicate he said now you know why they messed up your teeth no i dont i dont hang out with you and your eavesdropping youre never going to like anything to hear over here from me man you people was involved in the murder of my parents you people tried to steal over  billion dollars from properties in private mansion vaults or you stole over  billion you stole over  billion in new york city you stole  billion from another house see the reason why rich people have money in their vaults is for protecting the property protecting their identities and for other reasons but you know in reference to people having private vaults these people stole what was  something billion in beverly hills and theyre blocking me from going home to my mother and fathers mansions because theyre trying to steal the monies is that how much it was how much was it that they stole they stole like uh what and theyre trying to steal what another  billion dollars theyre trying to steal out of one of my mother and fathers mansions in a private vault somebody say oh they said oh was it hidden money im gonna tell you you better quit hitting me in the teeth better quit hitting me in the teeth man im telling you my my teeth are a part of my life my teeth are for me to kiss girls for me to look attractive not your any right you have no right to ever be touching none whatsoever you wont ever have any right and im telling you to quit i also might have to go with the vice grips on that oh were all protocols in the media hours a day but that person communicated something like oh does the treasury know about the money the treasury knows about the monies that my mother and father had involved of course they do everybody knows thats important so if anythings missing thats why we need those documents that the treasury has or information that they are aware of how many billions of dollars my mother and father had in their royal vaults and that doesnt take away from future earnings either but knowing that information of value is important for protecting the facts in history so yeah if youre wondering the treasury knows exactly how much money my parents had in vaults you want to know why not just because my parents had high ranking status at the treasury is very important in reference to keeping records because when youre on the good positive side of value everybody always wants to keep records of their their wealth and value so ramish the government man playing tricks come up man needs to go into court so if youre wondering why the treasury had records of that so nobodyd steal anything so if any anybody tried to to steal anything the value was on record i just thanked the value back then plus you know my father you know when he died he was frozen but in reference to my mother too when she died she was frozen so in reference to this situation of value and my accomplishments and records of value of and you know interest accounts and value of things goes up yeah i got the star wires on this mounted that little reflector er cover plastic cover on there so i guess the only thing to do now is to hook up the battery and try to  it but its already got it on there that way this job here putting this on here pretty much done so
