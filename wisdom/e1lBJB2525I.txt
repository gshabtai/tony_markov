there over  years man and i have not received nothing from the asthma association and in reference to my cdl physical i havent received any of the lawsuit monies and reference to these people trying to injure me and people blocking me from the trucking industry and i scored highest on the test and ive not received any of the monies from the teamsters lawsuits the reference to my mother and fathers companies and these people trying to hijack the companies plus the teamsters union and the screen actors union i have not received any of the lawsuit monies have not received any of the benefits that i was supposed to receive in reference to me being a celebrity and getting kidnapped from california not received any monies from the michigan governor or anywhere from any governors this still is a hostage situation and the utility companies in reference to the signing of the uh the uh pandemic uh stimulus or whichever which was delayed a week you know its been almost since the th you know thats like three weeks and bills come in you know and im not supposed to even have bills because this is a hostage situation and they kidnapped me from california so in roberts to california they need to review all the monies that these people stole from the postal mail all the monies they stole from celebrities that sent me money and the treasury i have not received nothing from there ive not received anything from any of the police departments that tried to send me money or information this still is a hostage situation the satellite man is trying to play the shake down or something theyre burning on me this is serious you know in reference to the delays of unemployment monies and stimulus monies ive not received anything from the irs not received anything from anywhere but i got a gnc advertisement in the mail today so you know in reference to uh this situation it is attempted murder against the government and theyre activities of this person and you know this person thats been stealing from me he tries to claim that that his family he always tries to communicate something saying his family needed money or something well theyre stealing my money theyre stealing my benefits they got to file their own benefit loss or benefit cases or something them stealing my monies is attempted murder im not associated with these people im not from their family these people that are stealing my benefits and ive not received any invitations or any travel arrangements my mother and father even had a budget for me to travel to different locations of my mother and fathers mansions and nationwide acknowledgements i havent received anything from the advent company and thats one of the companies thats possibly holding onto my trust funds and received nothing from anywhere but you know in reference to uh utilities the utility companies need to kind of do something to help people a little in reference to indiana because indiana is like last in the unemployment thing i guess because uh indiana has fall has fell on i miss my mouth has fallen behind or something i dont know if other states can come over to indiana to help the indiana unemployment office or not but you know i spoke to the girl on the phone for like  minutes and she said that you know she said they werent short-handed but its just taking a while taking a while for things to get processed and you know people need information its a very serious situation this is a kidnapping and hostage situation things are not being handled correctly and celebrities and entertainers and you know the beverly hills council have not received any information from there and this is you know a very serious abusive situation to government abusing me from satellite in the government uh claiming they tried to send me money how much money has governors and mayors written off in reference to the situation you know i havent received anything so i dont know what to tell you and its i know the procedures of things and what was supposed to go on and the fact that they were supposed to deliver the monies to my mailbox and i havent received anything theres procedures in this hostage situation because ive been held hostage before even back in the s they tried to starve me to death and they tried to make me look like a very poor person and thats an illegal thats violations of downgrading and people trying to steal my accomplishments and monies that i was supposed to have received you know this is very serious and you know i dont know what to tell you except for procedures theres books theres documents theres codes of lulls that tell people what they were supposed to do and the way they were supposed to deliver monies to me in the mailbox or you know they were supposed to deposit monies and accounts for me but i havent received anything so you know this is all on the record for court cases too so you know its one of those things you know people trying to play this empty-handed thing while everybody else is writing things off and people are being paid wages claiming they were trying to rescue me from indiana but i havent received nothing and i dont know if anybody paid on the utilities because on the website and the information it shows that you know i got to pay on the utilities they supposedly had court cases in indiana that about this hostage situation but yet the utility companies are still charging me money and im just mentioning the information in reference to it doesnt seem like procedures are being handled correctly you know im being nice about this and its my rights that are being violated my human rights have been violated never been a criminal never been involved in drugs never been involved in anything criminal but yet theres criminals stealing from me these people you know somebody might say you know girls in hollywood that are friends of mine girls that i was dating when i was younger girls that was on celebrity contracts to be girlfriends of mine in the media you know those girls need to make videos in reference to the relationship with me and monies that they may have been holding on to from my mother in reference to if i got kidnapped and held hostage i mean the procedure documents and all the codes of laws like for instance when somebodys holding me hostage theres a list of codes in reference to my specific status and my identity and what people are supposed to do because this has been a kidnapping situation and a hostage situation off and on for so many different times and so many different years so you know in reference to the procedures that need to be followed things are not being followed correctly and things are not you know being handled correctly so you know its one of those things its very serious somebody needs to check to see which governors and mayors written had written off millions of dollars in the efforts of them trying to rescue me that has to be on documents i havent received nothing zero i havent received nothing zero i have not received anything lots of things of importance low colorado and utah wyoming and texas and new york and new jersey low teamsters offices and all  states i guess and low tv networks havent received nothing from any of them real protocol my identities in the media  hours a day
