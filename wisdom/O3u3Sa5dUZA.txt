 is very important in reference to the lies of people and their false association and their sound alike words of what they have used uh the governments gonna have to pay for this probably in reference to companies changing words on their on their signs because germany has tried to claim that they created the the hamburger you understand that so in reference to all the companies the millions of signs that say hamburger on them is probably going to be called beef patties or beef uh meat something because the germans have tried to claim on google that they created the hamburger or something or the cheeseburger so it has to be changed on all the millions or hundreds of thousands of restaurant signs that are on the restaurants and all the different advertising and and grocery stores the word hamburger is not a german word but they are claiming that they thought it was a german word so then they tried to claim that they thought they created germans claimed that they thought cattle i guess came from germany thats not where cattle come from cattle or theres cattle in all different countries you know and they didnt come from germany so in reference to european uh food markets or american food markets the us government in reference to america and the us government has to pay for all the companies to change their signs to change the word hamburger into beef patty or something because the germans are trying to steal the beef industry of america and hamburger did not come from hamburg germany so in reference to germans up americans teeth because germans are trying to claim that they own the beef or the cattle industry in america so the governments gonna have to pay for all the companies across america to change their advertising into a different word besides humburg or hamburger because the germans are trying to steal the beef industry in america and other farms or something okay so the irs or the treasury needs to look into that because this country is not owned by germans and there is no way for them to legally be claiming that word they claim they created the word so obviously the us governments going to have to pay the hundreds of thousands of companies to change the word hamburger into something else so the germans dont try to murder americans to steal the beef industry in america with their psycho  attack of peoples lives with satellites you understand that so somebody then the government or the treasurys gonna have to pay for all the changing of those signs because most americans never think hamburger was ever hamburg so that needs to be changed in america so thats very important
