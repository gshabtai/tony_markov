 how you guys doing this is very important too somebody had communicated that they had uh somebody in indiana had a record uh had a check too that they were holding on to for like over  years theyve been holding on to this which was monies i was supposed to have received where i could have moved to a better neighborhood or something and it was like i guess i dont know if it was  million dollars that they were holding on to because you know they knew this was an endangerment situation im not sure which governor or mayor was involved in holding on to that check or which person or if if you know you have to look it up see what the story is on that because i dont have any of the records see usually people came over here to indianapolis and delivered monies to like the police station or the governor or mayor and i never received a letter about anything then that means theyre hiding the information you know so you have to look it up to see if thats factual or not if anybody ever delivered any monies to the city for me that i was supposed to have received or uh in reference to the government or this the capitol building or anything and uh you have to check to see uh which people they handed the monies to or the letter or whatever but i guess there was a letter that or some documents that somebody had presented to the capitol building or to the government in indiana that they were supposed to give me the monies and i was supposed to move to a better neighborhood and i never received the monies never received a letter never received none of it i havent received any of the lawsuit monies and remembers any of the abuses either and uh you know this neighborhood over here wasnt a snaggletooth neighborhood before it wasnt a teeth mutilation neighborhood before even though i was held hostage in this neighborhood back in the s you know somewhere around the s and uh i got rescued from this neighborhood and kidnapped and rescued and kidnapped and rescued and held hostage in this neighborhood you know several times but you know in reference to uh the history of the situation and the crimes of the people that stole the monies or whatever document was the document was about i was supposed to receive certain amounts of money or there was a check i was supposed to have received or something and i was supposed to move to another neighborhood and then i was supposed to possibly sit there for a little while to see if i received information and then and if not then i was supposed to travel to california but i received a letter i received the information so whichever person is holding on to that document that person probably needs to get arrested in reference to the person thats holding on to the document and the monies this was like  years ago is what somebody tried to say or what somebody tried to communicate but look up the information see if its true check the documents check the uh the history of that information but i guess it was like either  million or  million they were supposed to they came over and they delivered this check or something or they had a court case where i was supposed to receive this money and i was supposed to move to a better neighborhood you know because the government dirty man tries to make up about neighborhoods too you know whatever and he tries to attack him with satellites or whatever hes trying to do but uh you know ive been getting abused at this house the whole time and thats eve it was doing  years ago even when i was living up the other place i was supposed to receive money to get away from the ray family and some of these other people but i didnt receive the monies didnt receive the letter you know letter had some instructions on it or something and uh for me to move to another neighborhood closer to where my mothers mansions was at you know my mother had mansions in indianapolis too in indiana and my father had property in indiana too so you know its kind of a long story but uh you have to check the information to see if thats true or not but thats what somebody tried to communicate or something but that was over  years ago and that that moneys worth a lot more now its in probably in the billions because ive been getting abused because they held on to that money now you know in reference to anybody stealing or confiscating or intercepting monies in the postal mail most of its attempts of murder because they know that i wouldnt be in this neighborhood i would have moved to a better neighborhood or i would have went back to california or went to another city and state every time they steal money so pretty much every time they steal money from the postal mail its attempts of murder or anytime theyre squatting on money its attempts of murder because ive been getting abused every single day this is over   days of abuse theyve been burning me with satellites trying to make somebody hot under the collar swelling up my neck burning my lips and teeth and and other things burning the tailbone wheres the lawsuit remembers them burning my tailbone then burning my legs and the spider vein damage that they caused all these years and the teeth damage and the physical assault and sexual crimes of the government agents terrorizing my body and terrorizing my life wheres the lawsuit monies and in reference to that information about whether the indiana government was holding on to a check with either  million or  million or whatever theyve been holding on to there has to be court cases reference to every amount of money theyve been holding on to in remembrance of this hostage situation even if one of my friends from california or my mother or fathers company even if they sent me a couple hundred bucks wheres that even if they sent me thousands of dollars even if they sent me millions or even if they sent billions where is it there has to be court cases about everything and im not supposed to have to wait until they they go through all the court cases you know im supposed to receive money so i can move this is a hostage situations attempts to murder against the government every second of every day
