 guys doing this is very important in reference to many things somebody was trying to communicate or trying to say something like they was wondering if i was the son of uh walt disney or they thought i was the son of howard hughes well in recent information somebody needs to say what it says in the royal protocol because thats my birth certificate dna information who my mother is who my father is its internationally documented theres documents of it and many countries around the world and in america so somebodys wondering who my father is its some people might say oh they thought it was walt disney or they thought it was howard hughes well put it on tv man the role protocol is the birth certificate of my identity and it tells you exactly who my father is and who my mother is and documents who my grandfathers are and im the only child of my mother and father so you put the information on youtube you put it on the internet too all right role protocol my identity is forever
