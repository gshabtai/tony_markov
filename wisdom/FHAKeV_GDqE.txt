controversial but you know in reference to back in the in the s there was different types of uh rappers it was its thats only for entertainment purposes everybody make sure everybody understands that reverence to rap music dont take it too seriously out there in the urban world or out there in society you know dont get all you know out of control and people fighting you know its its kind of like that inner monologue of you know people listening to music chatting with their friends dancing around being calm you know talking things you know its not no rivalry of uh violence and  like that so you know reference to you know like you see some artists they have like their rivals in the music industry and things like that so dont get into no people you know reference to uh you know the different styles of rap music or the different styles of rock and roll and different styles of r and b and romance music and vh how you guys doing an mtv you know the music industry is a you know industry of music you know its its one of those things where you know it has its points of information has its points of uh you know enjoyment of people enjoying music and you know dont dont get into violence in reference to uh many things you know or controversial activities or you know the seriousness of any people having you know conflicts seriously so in reference to the honesty of uh people enjoying music music certain types of music is that over-the-top music so in reference to people understanding that you dont get out of control with yourself or in physical conflicts with things you know i mean theres situations you know like youve seen stories in the past of such and such person being in a rivalry with somebody else where you know no violence no no no uh things you know people its kind of like you know people will try to hype a boxing match sometimes but you know the fights in the ring you know what i mean so in reference to music or hardcore rap or what they call uh you know certain types of hardcore rap whatever its called and you know understand that that type of thing is you know the hype and the excitement of people jumping up and down having fun discussing things keeping people aware of the situation of you know certain things or people talking about things but you know people you know no violence people need to stop the violence between people and people need to be prosecuting these satellite controllers that have been burning me and terrorizing my life people in the media and the news networks need to be prosecuting if the news networks havent been in court against these satellite controllers then that means its a corrupt news network or something role protocols at all news networks of my identity and who i am and who my parents are a lot of things of importance but somebody wanted to know i guess if id done any uh hardcore rap in the past or whatever you know uh nothing uh and referenced any real violence or anything but some people say you know i ive you know you know how some people are in the rap game when people try to mess with rapper you know rap songs are they people want to like theyre throwing down like zoning on each other or you know in reference to certain conflicts of humor certain conflicts of things that are not supposed to be so serious its kind of like one of those you know media mediums that you know people just express some things like you know theres eminem hes had his controversies with uh kirkpatrick or whatever and im friend friendly about eminem of course most people know that and other people so you know and roberts two you know lit biscuit how are you doing acknowledgments of music and remembers to the band the group and other rap artists and things like that lots of things of importance you know people understanding making money is important enjoying things is important and people staying alive and healthy is important so in reference to the history of the future the history of you know rock and roll and its okay if black people like white music its okay black people like r b uh thats saying thats been saying by white people black people can like rock and roll music too you know our country music certain country songs i dont know theres certain country songs i like and then some other country songs are a little different you know so its kind of like our operatic music or classical music or piano or guitar and other things you know so remember to people enjoying things about life everybodys staying safe watch out for the coronavirus thing and and uh i havent received my stimulus check yet and its uh you know january th now i guess it is you know january th  but you know in reverence too i havent received anything from any of the uh rmb friends of mine or rock and rollers or country music friends that tried to send me me money or or uh or anything they messing with my mouth right now the satellite mans messing with my mouth but you know reference to rap songs or music or you know just remember or you know its its uh its a realm of entertainment people dont need to take it too serious in reference to people that are fans or listeners of the music in reference to any unnecessary conflicts that you know people can go into court about things people can talk about things but we want you know people want people to be able to enjoy music and and you know the different variables of music without people literally getting violent you know sometimes rap musics like people pumping up a boxing match or something you know and but you know behind the scenes people need to converse with each other on some things to keep things understood that you know violence is not a good thing among the music industry and other industries either lots of things of importance so the robbers say any rap music like uh somebody said something about easy e or warren g or snoop dogg dr dre uh or any other rap artists and producers and some other people how you guys doing or jive records or you know other types of record labels you know friendly acknowledgements and country music and you know rock and roll and pop music you know people eat you
