lawsuits and reference to people trying to block me from my entertainment career too where some people like you know im the owner of my mother and fathers companies and production companies and and many things of course but then these people trying to make me look like a nobody at my own mother and fathers companies you know thats thats criminal theyre still hitting me in the teeth right there they just did that thats total you know my baby teeth when i was growing up was straight my adult teeth was straight you dont have a right damaging the shape of things you sicko and you know the satellite man has communicated claiming he wanted to be who i am look go stand on a stage man lets see your performing arts on work on a stage damaging peoples teeth is not a part of the performing

kinds youre violating the modeling industry you have no legal right damaging my face or teeth my career is more valuable than your career government man your activities of terrorizing my life is criminal but anyways back to the point some people want to know which actors and entertainers ive performed as and then the studios had to use a stand-in in reference to me being kidnapped or me being held hostage or me uh being in one movie and then being in another movie and in another movie and you know i was in a lot of movies growing up and tv shows so you know a lot of people know that in reference to my mother and father the particulars of me playing one type of character and then having to wear a costume and you know a makeup artist that you know did makeup or skin color or whichever you know that was in reference to you know my mother and father owning production companies and the studios which my father owned and you know production companies and things like that so in reference to people the fact that ive played numerous characters of different you know colors or different looks or you know you know ive always played a character with a larger nose than my real nose and sometimes i played characters that that didnt have teeth as pretty as mine and thats with you know the makeup artist theres people that make those particular designs of things the satellite man damaging my real teeth is attempted murder look at all the movies and tv shows ive been in growing up when ive had different looking teeth my teeth are real teeth but in film and movies sometimes i wear a costume so reference to you damaging my real teeth that is unacceptable in any way no matter who the hell you are and you must get prosecuted but you know in reference to uh you know entertainment or movies or career acknowledgements people want to know you know which characters i performed as they know i play a lot of characters in movies and tv shows too and singing and performing performing as a black artist or different or maybe a latin artist or a particular types of genres of music or rap artists or rock and roller of course rakhan i love rock and roller bundles and country music rock on and r b rock on and classical music and operatic music rock on and you know music and history and directing and producing you know all that stuffs got to be put out there the reference to which people have been stand-ins for me when ive been held hostage which people have been stand-ins when ive went from one character to another character in reference to productions and you know history of productions and hello stuntmen association i havent even received a letter from anybody and uh i guess gotta continue pursuing my truck driving career because you know these people are blocking me from my entertainment career you know its a very serious thing you know im supposed to be at the corporate offices two of the studios my mother and father own the studios and im the owner of the office locations at the studios you understand that but yet peoples right to try to block me when ive been the owner of the studio since i was a little boy because my parents gave me everything but my parents worked as executives underneath me at the companies in which my parents gave to me and theres lawsuits and remembers to the government murdering my parents as they were working as executives underneath me wheres that lawsuit money wheres the insurance money from the studios wheres the money wheres my revenues where you know these impersonators are not allowed to steal my revenues when theyre a stand-in or where i have been you know held hostage or people tried to injure me or people tried to rape me or people tried to bully me or whatever you know so a lot of people want to know which characters i performed as and which characters did we have to use stand-ins for after you know during these types of times when ive been held hostage you might be surprised in reference to films and somebody communicate about the movie seven and hello morgan freeman and gwyneth paltrow and other people that are in the film and uh the drill sergeant from uh full metal jacket within the movie too and uh so in remembrance to you know people wondering what films and what people they use as stand-ins like ill perform as a character ill dress up as a character whether its a different hairstyle different you know different makeup or different color uh skin or or different types of characters you know but you know in reference to the information you know a lot of people in the productions they know when i perform as an artist in film then some people dont even know its me but then later on its supposed to be kind of revealed like usually after the oscars or you know like if i performed in a film that particular time you know where people judge it on a neutral basis such as me dressing up as a different character a different uh different type of character in film whether its a different you know friendly race or i wont play no german or middle easterners im not gonna have no plans of playing any of those characters and uh you know in reference to romance movies or comedies or action films or whichever you know romance comedies or you know particular history of things so you know in reference to uh what a lot of people say you know reference to me performing in a film if its if its something that might be nominated for an oscar or usually every year its supposed to come out that it was a role that i played you know as a character and you know if it doesnt even get close to being nominated for an oscar or anything like that then usually after usually after a year theyre supposed to reveal that it was me in that particular film or tv show or something or directing you know because you know a lot of directors use uh sub category names because of uh people get some people get freaky but yet in reference to the media certain films like if its like a horror film or like you got stephen king and wes craven and you know uh michael england they direct you know they put their name out there too you know in reference to films or anything like that so you know its sometimes you you hear like the uh the particular point of uh ghost writers or ghost uh directors where they use a different name because if its like some controversial type of subject or scary movie some people dont know what to think and then then you got bad people that really try to hurt people like stalkers and stuff when its just a you know a fictional film you know or whatever so you know thats why theres laws in reference to uh government or police or psychos or rapists to ever act upon the storyline or a plot of a film so you know their safety and security guidelines and audience guidelines too like for instance you might see a film or a movie and say well wait thats a controversial movie or something or its a scary movie or an action movie where its a fictional movie and people dont have a right attacking the director or attacking the performers in the film because they didnt like the film because somebody is some weirdo that cant uh understand that its a fictional film or just a you know particular type of film or whatever documentary or or whatever something is you know so you know theres guidelines in reference to audiences thats why it says all the characters in this film are fictional or you know certain things that it says in reference to movies when theyre being filmed or when theyre being after theyve been filmed and you know so its kind of like you know theres some directors that direct romance movies and a lot of people like that and then theres some people that direct horror movies and then some people think oh like if you like like stephen king or wes craven or michael england or any movies i directed or anything or you know anything in the history of things where somebody would say were used to this person directing you know this kind of movie and thats like their mainstream productions or their mainstream like a romance director or a comedy director or action film director where they have like a you know a following of people that follow their types of movies where then somebody does another movie and theyre like oh i dont know about that movie thats a different type of movie and you know someone else say well theyre so used to this following of this director being a drama director or a action film director and then they then they tried their their hand at romance and some people liked it some people didnt and then somebody will say well that that might mess up the following of that director directing romance movies if he did some horror uh violent movie fictional movie you know that kind of thing so thats why sometimes in reference to different directors they they stay in certain categories or they they have ghost titles in reference to uh or anonymous titles or fake names that they use for whatever type of film that they might have a direct might have directed from the various types of films like say if their history is action films and then they tried their chance at romance in reference to directing the film sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt you know usually the audience likes some things and then sometimes they dont you know it just depends on things you know thats why certain anonymous names or fake names are used in films or directing or performing arts because you know somebody has a following in one area and then their other area that they directed or performed and may not have done so well so then they they kind of some directors focus on you know their bread and butter you know what i mean what or you know whatever is the kind of category that they have the most following in in reference to you know story lines or plots so many things are important so in reference to films that ive been in and you know where i have performed and then they had to use a stand-in you know a lot of people want that information kind of revealed in reference to history of media or hollywood with me growing up and being in films and music and other things lots of things of importance
