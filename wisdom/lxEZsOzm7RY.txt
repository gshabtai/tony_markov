 you guys doing this is very important in reference to my mother and the fact of when i was held hostage here back in the s and my mother had to spend im not sure she spent like over  million dollars in indiana during the time these people was holding me hostage because my mother didnt know what else to do so my mother had spent like  million dollars or whatever or close to a billion or something im not sure exactly what the number is but my mother even built some mansions in indianapolis specifically for me but these people still kept holding me hostage in this neighborhood they still kept holding me hostage in a poor lifestyle thats why i dont you know im supposed to date certain kind of girls that have certain successes and certain amounts of money so they would never try to gold dig on me and you know they know certain careers like hollywood celebrity females and particulars of things these people are blocking me from the mansions that my mother had
