 hey guys doing this is very important in remembrance of the court system not doing their jobs you know my parents got murdered by people that should have been in prison people my parents had had court cases against and people some of them had went to prison and somebody had illegally allowed them to get out of prison and they murdered my parents so remembrance of the courts not doing their job in this situation is consistent violations of law and the fact of serious endangerment based on the uh neglectful activity of the courts where they have allowed their government agents to sneak out of prison when they have violated my rights and my status and these people stealing my court case monies and lawsuit monies ive not received anything yet this is a total injustice and the supreme court is responsible for the crimes of these people because the supreme court does know who some of these people are
