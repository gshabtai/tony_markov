 hey guys this is another thing of importance in reference to when diane armadillo fell out fell down outside on the carpet outside my apartment door the cops showed up right right around that time too when because they said something about wild music or something because when we were over when we was at my little apartment it was somebodys birthday i dont know i guess i dont know it was dianes birthday or whoevers birthday it was but we went out to some of the clubs and when we came back to my apartment i dont know why we kind of stopped you know we stopped there at my apartment and there was like a few people there and small apartments it was a little studio apartment and the music was you know they turned up to music whoever was hanging out at that little gathering i didnt know most of those people whoever they were they were her friends or something but uh in reference to the information the cops showed up outside the door outside the balcony and said the music was too loud so then you know but i was telling everybody to leave because diane and her friends was ing to talk about drugs and i was like no im not into no drugs or nothing like that so everybody you know people somebody was talking about drugs and she was one of the people i guess that was talking about drugs and i said hey everybodys got to leave and then the cops showed up and said that you know i told everybody to leave and then theyre messing with my throat and uh because they said something about the music was too loud so i was telling everybody to leave then she pulled a stunt i guess it fell down outside the apartment door because i told her to leave then i told everybody else to leave but then you know i was still kind of dating her a little there after that so her falling down didnt wasnt like uh you know that particular point of uh the relationship of friendship or whatever i even told my friends it was not very serious of a relationship me dating her they even told uh my friend tripp i told raymond i told you know everybody even when i was dating laura lee or uh hello heather graham how you doing lots of things about importance but uh and hello uh t-bahs and chili hey guys doing many things about importance see a lot of people in hollywood hollywood a lot of girls knew me and theyve known me a long time and uh so in reference to females in hollywood they knew which people was trying to run scams which people was trying to play tricks on me you know these government people or most people knew who some of these people were but when diane armadillo fell down outside the apartment she she fell down on the carpet it wasnt like nothing serious but uh you know the point of information then uh her and some dirty cops tried to murder me at the rainbow i guess is who these people were and i had to get stitches in my ear you know one of my ears but uh they tried to jump me and they tried to murder me at the rainbow and then one of my friends his names steve i guess he was yes steve was there and theres a couple other people that was hanging out with us at the rainbow i went to the bathroom and these people you know there was a line for the bathroom and i walked past the guys that was in line i was trying to get to the end of the line and this man grabbed me by my shoulders and kind of gripped my arms and like somebody grabbing somebody by their arms and holding them like both arms you know like like hang on like somebody grabbing you like like this and i was like hey man get off me you know and he said something about some line was over there or something and uh him and like three other people tried to jump me in the bathroom at the rainbow and the united nations probably has this on record too but uh and then i got punched in the face when i was at the uh universal studios man hit me in the face and teeth when i was there with a friend named robert porter because see we went to bb kings to listen to music and uh it seemed like it was a setup somebody was trying to play tricks but you know bb king knows me a lot of celebrities have known me since i was a little boy in hollywood there were old protocols in the media you know and uh this guy was picking a fight with robert porter or something and i kind of like stood there and i was stood in between i was like okay you guys dont fight not like and then the guy punched me in the mouth he punched me in the face and then i guess robert porter punched him and then the universal studios security personnel was there and i said hey look at my face you know they damaged my face and teeth i might not my teeth but my lips my face was swollen and theyd hit me in the mouth this guy did but uh i didnt say i wasnt doing nothing i was just like you know telling people to stand back and then it got sucker punched and this is attempted murder too ive not received the lawsuits from universal studios no matter where im at and check the information upon the owner of universal studios and other studios reference to my mother and father and grandparents in a little walt disney world lots of things of importance in the low warner brothers studios and uh cbs nbc abc this is very important i mean this if that guy that punched me in the mouth wants to step in the ring but you know the same thing with these other three guys that jumped me at the rainbow i guess they were all trying to steal my penis they were tied in with the men trying to steal my penis or something but uh these people was working for the man that was working for diane armadillo setting up this framing situation now you know at my apartment with  fountain and gardener they had police reports of men stalking me which i dont know who these people were but somebody from walt disney world possibly knows who all these men were dirty cia or dirty fbi man that was involved in the murder of my parents some of them was trying to murder me in hollywood and they were trying to use diane armadillo as their front when these people had shot me in beverly hills when i was younger when my mother was alive because when my mother got shot i got shot that same night when they trespassed into my mother and fathers mansion and these men had tried to murder me back then and these men had conspired against me and had been conspiring against me and they were trying to use somebody to go along with them in their way of trying to murder me or trying to scam me or trying to frame me and at the rainbow on sunset boulevard these uh the mystical meth the uh men tried to jump me and they were tied in with these dirty cops i dont think the dirty cops from westwood or the dirty cops from west hollywood and she tried to fake this fall or something or whatever it was but you know theres no statute of limitations of catching all these people the real protocol is in the media of my identity and my family history and who i am and my financial class and financial wealth see the government when they try to scam somebody they try to frame somebody they try to use common-looking people or they try to use people that are from a different background than what im from because im in the one percent of the one percent of super wealth where i would you know from what uh my family history and grandparents and celebrity status and somebody wants you to know they just choked me again somebody i want you to know some of these people tried to steal the screen actors union and the directors union and writers union too its like this organized political crime ring of bad people that are trying to do these things and you know these guys tried to jump me at the rainbow and i was just trying to go to the bathroom or something i was just trying to go to the bathroom and then they jumped you know theres a line and uh they thought they were tough trying to pick on me and the united nations might even know who some of these people are but you know the history of the situation of these people conspiring against me and these people playing this uh blocking game of them blocking me from my mother and fathers mansions these people have to get prosecuted whoever they are but uh these people attacking me for over  years these people was tied in with diane armadillos father or some of these political murderers that tried to murder celebrities in hollywood and i guess they were using her and she was tied in with some other people that had tried to conspire against me and look to see what part of uh sunset plaza my father owned or sunset boulevard like my father owned sunset boulevard didnt he from santa
