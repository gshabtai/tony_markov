 kind of hard to see let me see how many things Music is Music um i might want to just make a fruit one right now but if it feels like everything Music Music as they have on the year still been strong as a road so yeah Music someone like you a millionaire welcome back march place your first bet risk-free plus everyone gets a free shot when they bet the tournament this is johnny carsons show this is

oranges this is a mango hello cucumber some of your girls you might pick out cucumbers you like or some of you guys i dont know im not getting straight everybody knows that this is broccoli so ill probably make a fruit one first because i got some bananas i got celery theres another orange so you know lets see what finally first plus i got my malibu blend bag of veggies some broccoli i might throw a few things in there some things have to be cut and bananas now remember to making juices you know a lot of people like a lot of fruit juices of course and they like a lot of uh choices of juice machines you know or whatever but in reference to people you might you know it might get somewhat expensive it might be a little way but you know a lot of people like making their own juices too so sometimes you know putting an additive in there like you know such as a uh he might buy you a theres some grapes grapes but you might buy yourself you know some veggies or fruit green apples like green apples but you might buy yourself you know a variety of fruit where you use in your juice maker and you buy an additive like you might buy some extra juice because you want to put the pulp in there or you want the more stronger banana taste or orange taste or you know you kind of you kind of create your own little different uh varieties of what juices you like so instead of like you know using your juicer and say oh wow this gets expensive or whatever and then throwing it out in your garage or storing it away you might just find a way of you know getting certain fruits and vegetables on over a periodic time and getting you and out of get an added juice like you know you might buy some apples and you might buy some apple juice too because you wanted some extra pulp or you wanted you know a different variety of blends of different fruits like you know five alive is really good the tipton juice company has some good things too of course and you know you make your choices you make your varieties that you want to look at and you want to get for you know whatever juice youre trying to make but sometimes putting a little additive in there wets it down a little or you know you know makes it a little more pulpy and its kind of less expensive somewhat if you you buy maybe a juice that youre you frequently use you know just as an additive so you might put pulp in it and then other types of varieties of veggies or juice or fruits and then you just add you know a little you know cup or half a cup of regular juice that way you keep your you know juice working you know your juice machine you know active or you know you keep yourself a little active and it helps a little price wise if you kind of buy a you know an additive juice that you can add to your your blend of things if if it gets too costly for you and thats a good thing for a lot of people that that use juice makers and they have their choices of their favorites and what they choose for their uh particular regiment of their exercise or their activity of bodybuilding or smoothies or or whichever youre just you know straight fruit juices and you got your choices so that way you kind of keep yourself you know actively involved if you wanted to be in reference to being you know making your own juices which is cool you know so its kind of like if it gets too costly you know maybe buy you some grape juice or cranberry juice to add it in there with it too you know in reference to you know the pulp and the the fruit that you use for your juice maker so its kind of like this is a new juice maker i got it today and so its kind of uh one of those things where you know using certain things buying certain things and you have your choices and things you like so its kind of kind of go with the flow on some things that way you kind of keep it you know somewhat inexpensive for yourself so you dont get you know overwhelmed with you know buying you know large amounts of veggies and large amounts of fruit where you could you know you want the choices that you want but then you kind of want to add maybe a little extra juice from a bottle you know a fruit company or vegetable juice its always wonderful just to add more volume to your your production of your own juices that you make in your own choices that way you keep yourself you know in tune with your own anatomy in tune with your own little concoctions of juices that you make for your for your uh nutrition and health purposes so you know you dont so you dont get overwhelmed with you know like you go to the vegetable store and or you go to the market supermarkets and then you buy you know   worth of vegetables and then you come out with you know just you know maybe half a gallon of juice and youre just like well thats kind of expensive you know whatever the variable variable prices are in reference to the markets so its kind of good if you kind of just you know make a choice go along with your choice and then maybe get you an additive like a you know a bottle of juice that way you can kind of you know keep things going and you dont feel like uh like youre losing well on you know spending a lot of money on things so its kind of you know one of those things where you contemplate price you contemplate you know the activity of things and then you kind of say well you know it gets expensive so then you say well you know just add a little juice from a bottle and get more volume you know and then thats one of the things you can do so you dont you know so you keep yourself active you keep yourself active with you know making juices and having fun and liking your own choices you know what i mean or choices of you know varieties of companies you know theyre like doles a good company hello dole how you guys
