you know hopefully uh some people think that george michael might still be alive and same thing with a lot of other artists hopefully theyre still alive but there was probably some communistic political abuses going on in hollywood so were not sure you know some celebrities might still be alive if anybody is wondering and you know their dna is important history of information fingerprints

theres theres something going on either theres communists trying to steal hollywood or theyre trying to steal beverly hills or theyre trying to steal america whoever these bad people are so obviously thats a point so in reference to people knowing that when if im being blocked from hollywood then everybody knows theres something going on because the real protocol of my identities in the media  hours a day and status information too so in reference to that thats basic information but in reference to uh the george michael biography um im not sure if im going to be in that uh you know george

reasons and my parents and grandparents history lots of things of importance you know and all the artists my mother and father sang as has to be advertised even if they painted their skin even if my mother or father dressed up as a black artist or an asian artist or any artist back in the day when you know they performed its got to be known you know my father sang as a black artist sometimes my mother sang as a black artist sometimes yeah and country music too lots of things of importance anything some importance so i rambled to the george michael biography i dont know uh if i be uh performing in the george michael biography or just a historic film of characterization like uh im not sure if its going to be just like if because somebodys trying to communicate something wanting me to be in the george michael uh biography which its not so much some things are not always like theres going to be that biography and then theres going to be the biography of because some people like certain characters or certain artists or certain types of uh media productions of things of an artist and some things like a soap opera artist its not always about the media but sometimes you know friendly lifestyles of history of an artist like some characters are artists and theyre singers and performers and this is going to be new uh media of productions and kind of like some things about certain characters of everyday life of an artist but on the sense of not just them being the singer but yet them having certain characterizations in film or romance movies or television or drama or action films too
