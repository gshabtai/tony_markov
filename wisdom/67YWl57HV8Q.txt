 this is very important in reference to uh labor laws and you know the screen actors union has laws in reference to union films and payroll everybody knows that right you know in reference to revenues and residuals of the companies that i was supposed to have received you know theyre all protocols in the media its in all films im supposed to get paid in reference to everything thats on television you know that right im the owner of the media companies im the owner of the distribution of uh technological distribution of media and tv stations and radio stations and i was supposed to receive paychecks now the screen actors union has to do a review on how much money i was supposed to received from each and every tv station radio station and from uh the productions and so does some of the other offices in reference to uh the situation of the companies the activity of productions theyre still active and theyre you know im not sure if theyre gonna have to strike against uh the uh particular situation but in reference to the media and me not receiving my revenues and im the owner of the companies there seems to be a major problem with the uh accounting department or something you guys know that right reference to movies and residuals and revenues that i was supposed to received in reference to things that are on television or things that are on the radio things that are on cable networks or you know wi-fi television or whatever so in reference to the media companies that im the owner of they need to be doing a review of why i havent received my money but the companies are still producing more movies and more television shows but yet i still havent received any of my revenues the screen actors union knows about these kinds of things theres uh people that have college educations that are supposed to be working in those types of departments that are supposed to be aware of the fact of people stealing or squatting on my revenues that i was supposed to have received so obviously that needs to be another court case why other people at the companies have been receiving paychecks but the owner which is me i have not received any revenues somebody needs to explain that information wrong protocols in all tv shows and movies from the production companies and there needs to be a court television uh court case about that or a new court tv show or something i havent seen anything on tv or youtube yet and the fcc knows this information and i havent received any of my revenues from social media havent received any of it from any of the social media so obviously theres lawsuits there too
