 this is very important you know the role protocol is in the news media too and uh in reference to the news stations in indianapolis you know i have not received any letters from them or any emails in reference to the tv channels or radio stations in indianapolis does anybody know whats going on with that and uh didnt my mother buy some tv stations in indianapolis or something my father owned the most tv stations in the country but and my mother she probably uh you know had management or something and some of them but i havent received a letter from any of the news networks and im supposed to be able to go to a news network anytime because theyre real protocols there too real protocols at all news networks in in america too so you know in reference to the news media these these government people have been blocking me from the news media ive called channel  and uh i dont know if les mundes uh tried to send me money before or what or any of the other news networks but nothings ever arrived and um you know in reference to the la times or new york times have not seen any information of any of the news stories you know in reference to this situation of me being held hostage on the internet or anything and you know i was in the la times before ive been in the magazine before the newspaper before and theres uh articles of me when i was a child celebrity when i was younger and other times when movies and tv shows when i was younger and uh these people blocking information about me and my career and dont forget my i have a very long career in the future too you know im theres probably over a thousand more movies i have to be in and tv shows and productions of my mother and fathers production companies and uh so you know reference to the news media i dont know if theyve tried to contact me you know some of them have been in restaurants where ive worked uh during this hostage situation and you know im supposed to be a newscaster too and possibly las vegas and la and some other places and you know somebody had said that cnn was trying to hire me and um court tv i havent received any of the monies if you tried to send anything but you know in reference to uh the situation you know the local news ive not received a letter from any of them and some of them know me like some of the newscasters knew me back in the s when i was held hostage here plus my mother had went to the news networks and uh or shed sent somebody over there in reference to the news networks and ive been in newspapers and magazine articles before and uh these people holding me hostage trying to steal my identity you know all those news networks all the newspapers all the magazine companies uh need to file charges against these people for trying to steal my identity you guys know that right so in reference to uh the newscasters or uh the news networks and hello las vegas news network somebody tried to communicate about the las vegas news network because im supposed to be a newscaster out there or something and uh havent received nothing and you know i own my mother and fathers tv stations and radio stations and production companies and studios forever this is just absurd you know i think people are i think theres some people that are just now i know people are scared of the satellite controllers because they know theyre very violent and theyre dangerous and sickos but in reference to uh the situation you know ive been in the media my whole life since i was born you know i was born as the richest kid in history of the world my mother and father was two richest people in the world you know and my parents employed a lot of people and followed the guidelines of employment followed the guidelines of running companies followed the guidelines of uh wages my parents didnt set the national wage dont try to blame my parents because of you know people saying something about oh they thought your parents being super rich yeah my parents being super rich does not determine your wages or anybodys wages theres a national set market of or its documented in reference to what the national wages were back then dont try to make up lies you know these people tried to make up lies when they tried to sell their copyrights to my father or my mother in reference to any music or anything like that and then these people wanted to make up lies because you know those people wanted quick money back then you know they were they were paid like seven cents uh uh every time a song was played or whatever but these people wanted millions of dollars up front so in reference to the studios buying their uh copyrights they were paid in full and then these people spent and blew their money then they tried to reattach their self to things that they had sold to the studios meaning they were they were trying to play double indemnity meaning like they sold their uh copyrights to the studios not me im not ever selling my copyrights to nothing but you know in reference to they sold their copyrights to the studio and then they went out and blew their money and then they tried to reattach their self to their copyrights that they had already sold and they had blown their money and then they tried to steal the studios then they tried to steal the tv networks then they tried to steal the radio stations after they were already paid in full so its double indemnity crimes of these people trying to extort trying to steal things that they sold like for instance they blew their money and then over time over years sometimes things appreciate in value like somebody else say you know a car value at this time you know it has a certain value then it depreciates and then if it becomes a classic then the value goes up over time if it appreciates see these government these people that are tied in with trying to steal the studios are a bunch of scam artists and liars and cheats and thieves and some of them you know their tricks are criminal and these people tried to kidnap me and help theyve been holding me hostage after they kidnapped me in indiana you know these people are trying to play their double indemnity crimes and then they like when they when they were paid for their copyrights oh they were they were happy then werent they but then they blew their money and then they were trying to make up saying that they thought they were underpaid because of the when they were paid money at that market value or that time and then then things appreciated because my mother and father had uh advertised and and produced more activities of that particular media then these people wanted to make up lies saying they thought they were underpaid when they were paid in full before and then you know when things appreciated after they blew their money they wanted to make up lies saying they were underpaid when they were paid for their copyrights a long time ago these people so you know you gotta think about particular particulars of uh market value theyre messing with the ml you gotta think they just pinched on my lip like they they try to they do this on the lip like its attempted murder man stay out of my face youre gonna be going to prison one of these days you dirty sick freak but you know in reference to uh you know newscasters and uh the history i you know i havent received and im supposed to be an executive of my mother and fathers companies you know im the owner of my mother and fathers estates so you know in reference to these people trying to play their tricks whoever they are they can get arrested for defrauding me and holding me hostage and people trying to steal my lawsuit monies these people are scam artists whoever they are and its attempted murder every day and newscasters i dont know uh you know how if any of the tv stations was holding onto monies from my mother or not or any of the companies i havent received any of the revenues or dividends or anything or any letters from any of the newscasters and receive anything from governors or mayors either so you know this is a hostage situation and you know governors and mayors need to put it on record that what they have tried to send monies or uh information because its a nationwide uh hostage situation reverence too because my parents owned property in just about all  states so you know all governors and mayors was kind of obligated to understand what these uh or the situation is and what kind of hostage situation it is lots of things of importance
