 and how you guys doing and in reference to directors that have worked with me when i was little you know when my mother and father was alive too you know my father produced a lot of shows my father was the number one producer in hollywood history and you know reference to movies too you know remembers to my fathers studios and my mother too and you know reference to family history of course there was other people that you know did a lot of productions and tv shows and things like that so and remembers to uh and wonderful directors and producers of friendly acknowledgements you know so in reference to the history of uh directors or writers or cinematographers or musicians that have worked with me in history of hollywood you know people need to make some documentation of it you know put it on youtube or in reference to like uh somebody to me okay something about steve mcqueen and some of the movies you know i was on some sets when i was a little boy and uh somebody was talking about uh something somebody tried to communicate something about the stunt driver uh acknowledgments or something uh back in the whenever it was or you know when i was a little boy you know in movies or whatever so you know you know its kind of a long story in reference to some things but you know in reference to uh the directors writers and production crews that have worked with me and music or movies and tv you know need somebody to make some youtube videos about it just you know saying whether you know if you want to be uh explicit about it like you know details of what characters ive played in movies yeah i was just watching on uh here i was watching the gamer movie you know its about video games you know its like people trying to play voodoo control of peoples lives or something you know some people was wondering if i was in that movie or if i was in some other movies uh somebodys gonna make a video about it and uh you know of course you know theyre particulars of directors and writers and cinematographers like ive mentioned in other actors and and uh musical you know duets or uh whichever musical group that ive sang with you know ive made this information mentioned before in video you know and you know ive mentioned this before and in reference to the history of things you know in reference to people its going to get lost in history and you know i dont know if people are intentionally not making videos or making documentation of things but you know screen actors union has uh fingerprints and documentation of tv shows from when i was a little boy and that sounded like man made me burp and uh you know so its kind of a long story of history very important in reference to uh you know history museums and the film and television museum and the screen actors union havent received a thing from there either and my father and mother and my family history of course im supposed to have an office at the screen actors union arent i did my father own the screen actors union many things about importance so anyways reference to movies and tv shows and you know action films or romantic movies or you know you know the the point of uh you know directors and writers and cinematographers that are gonna stay in hollywood without uh i mean if people are conflicting with who i am or my ownership of things in hollywood or in the media you know its just gonna go along with that fact of you know im the owner of my mother and fathers properties and companies and look to see if im the largest owner of land in california too you know its this is this uh a major hostage situation and its illegal for people in this country to allow the germans or the middle easterners to be trying to control hollywood or them holding me hostage or anything or them blocking me from having relationships with a girlfriend but anyways remember to the movie the gamer its about video games like voodoo video game stuff or whichever and a reference to people have seen me with my muscles on or and athletic accomplishments you know this is gonna have to be very important in reference to uh the guidelines reference to you know bodybuilding history how much i can bench press how fast i can run you know how many yards did i ever get if i played in the nfl was i one of the number one leading rushers in nfl history someone might say i dont know you have to ask people need to advertise this information because people can get arrested if they dont acknowledge certain things in reverence  plus my parents own sports teams and im the owner of my mother and fathers estates forever nothings ever for sale so anyways lots of things of importance directors writers and cinematographers and fashion industry you know fashion designers oh and i guess some limousine drivers in reference to any of my mother or fathers properties some of those people i guess are gonna get fired because nobody just came over so its like people are squatting on limousines people are squatting on things i guess i dont know so obviously and todays date is june th or th th  so in reference to uh im watching the gamer movie its not like like i mentioned before voodoo like video game robot you know people trying to control peoples bodies and stuff anyways and hello models and actresses and females and received any letters and received anything and you know this is uh its considered a crime in reference to people trying to cut off communications with me and my own companies of my mother and fathers estates you know its pretty serious you know people trying to play castaway games like the tom hanks movie castaway yeah this is pretty serious its all going to catch up with these bad people eventually and people are going to go to prison anyways so reference to people want to making uh if they want to make uh videos and you know tick tock videos or something youll make it into history books because its part of history in reference to this situation pretty much a lot of things are in reference to uh if uh people are gonna you know make videos theyll go in the history museum and reference to this hostage situation too one of the things of importance
