 guys doing this is very important in reference to c trucking and theyre conspiring against me with their uh shoddy equipment you know in reference to and the state of indiana cdl licensing uh location where they have intentionally conspired against me by trying to make me use a semi truck that has a power steering problem and it this is no ***** you know they they are conspiring against me they intentionally they even brought there was even a new truck that they wanted me to use or somebody had sent it or it was one of the ones they had repaired and it was ready for use but then somebody had put the trailer on it where the skid plate and the slide plate was too close where the truck could not turn then he checked it out and said he couldnt take it off there because it wouldnt work for some reason so he couldnt use that truck and that truck had better steering on it the truck that ive been using on the uh offset and parallel parking uh for the test was always extremely difficult and they put a  foot trailer on it and usually sometimes its a  the truck i was going to use had like a  but this one had a  foot trailer on it and they intentionally prevented me from using the red truck and made me use the orange truck that i always had a power steering problem id had to use this truck like maybe four or five times you know the whole time and the power steering got worse and worse now i know a satellite can put pressure on the power steering of a truck and cause it to not turn correctly you know the first test uh in reference to uh the pre-trip and stuff like that the in-cab or the four-point brake check went wrong and i did it again and i did it right but he said i did it wrong the second test was uh no well one of the the second process was when i was uh driving out of the parking lot and the truck died right there at this intersection before the truck even got out of the parking lot of the c training facility then what was the other one well it was like no well see there okay here it is first one brake check went wrong second one i had the same truck that i had now and it was the inspector and their names i can tell you the names but the inspector you know i pointed out trying to park this truck the second time the second you know first intro the break uh four point break check went wrong and then i did it again and he was like and then then i failed that but i did it right second time you know i was like oh wait a minute i want to  over hes like okay so i ed over and i got it right but then he still failed me on that the second one was uh i pointed out in reference to trying to park this truck that was the second one the third one was when i went through the parallel parking went to the other stuff everything went good and then driving out of the c parking lot to try to turn the corner the truck died right there in the intersection i had no involvement in that at all and it died you know right there but i ed up in like three seconds and had it moving so it doesnt look like it impeded traffic and i still had the green light but anyways that wasnt my fault either then the fourth test was driving and he said that i had went through a school zone and you know i was i even announced it that i was going you know under  proceeding under  and you know watching for hazard watching for pedestrians watching for things and uh then he said something like okay when you get up here i want you to turn right and i was like okay so you know still going about  miles an hour it was rush hour traffic yeah everybody was flying by still going slow you know and then we got he wanted me to get when i was gonna get over to the lane to go right he said how fast are you going like  miles an hour and hes like no  im like no  and he was like uh whatever so then he didnt say much after that so then we did the uh he said he wanted me to do an emergency stop so he did that and hes like okay thats good so then we drove on you know doing the bump and run doing the signaling turning and shifting right you know upshifting downshifting all the way and uh got over the street called the subway its like they called the subway or maybe subway street which is on emerson the subway goes over the bridge you know and uh they turned there and did fine went across the tracks we did fine came to the corner had to take make a right did fine and uh got back to this other road which did find riding down that road right by the mcdonalds past that got up to the light made the left and proceeded down to the next light and turned into you know to turn into turn lane to go into the school went fine everything like that got into the uh uh where the state tests where they parked their vehicles and i parked there and he was like oh youre driving is okay and fine and then and then he said something about the school zone he said something like well this and this and i said well i disagree you know but uh then i got pissed but i didnt say nothing to him i just went on and bitched and complained down the way you know when told derrick i said hey derek you know theres something wrong with that truck but even on the on the fourth time of that test i said hey there is something wrong with the steering i said when you steer it when you steer it like youre steering the steering wheel and you got to turn it real hard and i was sweating you know i was doing you know turning the steering wheel and then uh then it stops even when you pull real hard and it stops to turn the steering wheel then you gotta let off the brake and when it rolls it still goes like almost a quarter turn which even when youre doing that it still messes up but they changed the trailer on it too or they changed the whole truck because there was a red truck that was a serve a truck that was serviced that had better steering and uh even rob one of the guys there hes one of the instructors now you know this is you know what this truck has been doing you know satellite man was probably putting on the pushing on the power steering or they were in on it or somebody was in on it you know it was it was they intentionally made me fail the test im not bullshitting man ive done mechanics ive worked on vehicles ive worked on things i know what power steering is my mother and father own some companies and own some trucks too or something you know im not sure how many uh trucks my parents had out on the road or my grandparents i dont know if its a hundred thousand or what but either way i have no clue but you know in reference to uh companies grocery stores businesses department stores independent truck drivers teamsters union or whatever you know many things of importance but they intentionally did this to me where they made it was impossible impossible to turn and they got trick mirrors the mirrors vibrating ***** like this they get out of whack and they get all you know off centered and when you line them up they still get off centered theyre both both sides they sit there and jiggle and wiggle and stuff like that and i told them about that they didnt fix that they didnt fix the power steering either now this is another thing thats very important now in reference to the uh first well that was like one two the third test i had did the straight backing the offset left and right and the parallel left and right in robs truck which is a gray truck that he uses perfectly fine did nine exercises perfectly fine then that day i had the test it was we did four did uh five exercises the previous day four exercises the next day and then my test was that the next day but it was like four no hangouts five exercises just second five exercises then four exercises then the test was on the day i did the four exercises thats nine exercises that i did perfectly then they put me in this truck that has a shitty power steering check the dates check the information go over to c the news network needs to investigate man i need an attorney for this ***** too this is a hostage situation you know i got kidnapped from california the screen actors union needs to go over there and investigate why they did this to me why all these people ever did ***** to me people trying to steal my sperm at locations people wasting months of my time or weeks of my time i dont know if they had any involvement in that people trying to murder me on jobs people trying to murder me in the truck driving industry people blocking me from the truck driving industry you know they need to investigate i think the truck might be uh  now it drives forward okay on the road in some acknowledgements but it died the one day it died right there before i got out of the parking lot to see one uh truck driving training center and you know and i even typed that on there or something somewhere or mentioned it but the uh the point of it is today i did the offset i did the straight backing offset left we got through that the four-point brake check got through that then it was about time to uh to use the red truck but he had mentioned during my pre-trip that there were the landing gear was too close to the rear end of the tractor which i had nothing to do with they either had dropped the tractor the trailer there and then backed the truck up to it but this truck had better steering you know that right but the truck that i had to use had impossible steering now if they put a satellite on it thatll mess it up thatll make it almost you know you have to do it manually and its got those medium-sized steering wheels so you know its not a its nearly impossible when they do that plus the mirrors shaking on both sides you know like so it was it was sabotage and there has to be lawsuits either against the state or against c trucking for them making me have to use that truck because it was a c trucking testing truck its not my fault dont get mad at me im not the mechanic for the ***** truck ive been a good student i did things right i didnt schedule any of the activities the scheduling was scheduled by the director of c trucking the fact that they scheduled it so many days in between is not my fault i had absolutely nothing to do with the scheduling of when i did exercises at the c training facility the director made those decisions so the long period that it took all these weeks wasnt my fault i didnt schedule it it was scheduled by the director of c trucking now im a really nice person but people ***** on me trying to play tricks on me is not very nice and there is lawsuits and dirty government trying to murder me at c trucking i dont know some of their agents tried to sneak up or whatever or uh these people burning me with satellites theyve been burning me from satellites every single day i was there theyre burning me right now they i just left because there was the fifth test in the same god damn truck that has power steering problems maybe it didnt have problems for everybody else but i had my phone on me you know theres you could hear it going Music winding and ***** and stopping im not making it up not making excuses ive done parallel parking offset and straight backing in other trucks no ***** problem no problem at all even did it this morning before this test did the straight backing the offset right in the offset right and on the offset left and the parallel right and the parallel left the mess above my mouth when im talking they do this ***** all the time thats why i got damaged teeth because they try to make me stutter all the ***** time and when they have grabbed me and theyve been burning my teeth there has to be lawsuits that is not fair i was like oh good they got a new truck a different truck that i could use i even talked to rob hes one of the instructors and and guy is one of the instructors too that i spoke to and you know they were pretty cool and they knew i know how to drive the truck they know how to they know i know how to paralyze it parallel market and offset he even said today hes like yeah just go on over there do what you just did went over there did the pre-trip they had a different truck even told me they had a different truck over there but then the truck had a sliding plate which was too close to the trailer and the inspector said he couldnt change it he said hes not able to it wouldnt function he had to ask his boss at the state examiners office of the cdl and you know im always in the neutral zone everybody knows how some people always try to play tricks on me because theyre some of these people are tied in with the people that have been terrorizing me and the people that kidnapped me from my mother and fathers mansions in california in beverly hills and some of these people are involved in stealing the postal mail maybe theyre all cia maybe theyre fbi but british intelligence has to do an investigation so does italian intelligence asian intelligence needs to do an investigation canada needs to do an investigation mexico needs to do an investigation because theyre going to find out who everybody is to see what phone records are who people called over there to slander my character im not related to any of these indiana politicians im not related to nobody in the cia or fbi either and the screen actors union needs to send attorneys over there and say hey whats going on you know my mother and father produced movies and tv shows that had semi trucks in them and vehicles which is very important and boats and airplanes and other things and animals and horses so this is a serious activity of uh government sabotage and they were burning my face and teeth and they were sweating me when i was trying to park the truck now im not playing tricks man all these people trying to come down on me with their tricks theres lawsuits dont blame me youre the people that chose the ***** truck and uh joe was the one that brought the choke the truck over like the guy that was the instructor was bob the other theres an instructor named chuck im not an instructor but the inspector is bob theres an inspector named uh chuck and then theres an inspector named uh robert and i ive had to go through all them the uh bob is the one that did the last the four and five test chuck was the one that did my third test and uh robert was the first and second test at the indiana cdl state testing site and they made me use this truck every time theyve wasted my time theyve terrorized me with this truck this sexual assault chauvinistic crimes of government trying to sabotage my truck driving career trying to

attempted murder these people have slandered my character these government people and they sabotaged my uh straight backing offset parking and parallel parking at the state location and the c truck driving school is right next to the indiana state cdl licensing and they ***** know that truck is impossible nearly impossible to park when theyre ***** with the mirrors when theyre ***** with the power steering because when the mirrors are off then you try to find the landing gear and then the mirror shakes and moves like this then you think youre too far left or youre too far right and then you think this and then youll get this this kind of thing going on with the truck driver trying to trying to center the truck you know because you it doesnt come you know its not lined up right it
